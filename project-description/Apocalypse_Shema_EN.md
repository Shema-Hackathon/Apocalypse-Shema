## 1. Our Vision
We believe that Revelation, often seen as obscure and speculative, is above all a **message of hope and victory**.  
With **Apocalypse Shema**, we want to transform this reading into a **living experience**: not just reading the Bible, but truly **listening (Shema)** to it in order to take concrete and transformative action in daily life.  

---

## 2. The Pitch
**The problem:** Revelation is the most fascinating yet misunderstood book of the Bible. It often leads to fear and confusion, while its core is a call to trust and perseverance.  

**Our solution:** Apocalypse Shema, an AI-powered application that:  
- Explains complex symbols in a clear, contextualized way.  
- Engages users with interactive questions linking the text to their life.  
- Generates a **‚ÄúStep of Faith‚Äù**: a simple, personalized action to live out each day.  

By starting with Revelation, we showcase the strength of our **‚ÄúShema‚Äù** technology before extending it to the entire Bible.

## 3. User Experience
A clean and engaging conversational interface:  
- **Welcome screen:** ‚ÄúReady to discover the message of hope behind the symbols?‚Äù  
- **Shema Mode:** automatically activated when selecting a passage.  
  - **Understanding:** contextual explanations (e.g. ‚Äú666 and Emperor Nero‚Äù).  
  - **Reflection:** applying the message to today‚Äôs challenges (e.g. faithfulness under pressure).  
  - **Application (Step of Faith):** a personalized action based on the passage.  
    - Example: *Revelation 2:10* speaks of ‚Äúfaithfulness until death‚Äù. What small act of faith is God asking of you this week?  
    - Example: *Revelation 21* promises a new heaven and a new earth. How can this hope change your perspective today?

## 4. Roadmap
- **Version 1.0 (MVP):** Apocalypse Shema ‚Äì full module for Revelation.  
- **Version 2.0:** Add Daniel and Ezekiel (major symbolic sources).  
- **Version 3.0:** Shema for the entire Bible, with Revelation as the flagship module.  
- **Version 4.0:** Community features (sharing ‚ÄúSteps of Faith‚Äù).

## 5. Context and Technology
The project is built on solid and accessible technology:  
- **Frontend:** React Native mobile development for iOS and Android.  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node.js APIs to manage conversations and core logic.  
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Language models (OpenAI, Hugging Face) orchestrated by LangChain, fine-tuned with reliable theological sources.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or Firebase to store interactions and ‚ÄúSteps of Faith‚Äù.  
- **Design:** A simple interface, inspired by ChatGPT, but adapted to a spiritual and meditative context.  

In practice, the AI analyzes the user‚Äôs mindset, explains biblical passages, and generates a personalized action.  
This approach combines theology, technology, and psychology to make Bible meditation interactive and transformative.

## 6. Conclusion
**Apocalypse Shema** is not just an app; it is a **journey of personal and spiritual transformation**.  
If our method works for the most complex book of the Bible, it will work for all the others.
