1. Project Brief
Project Name	Apocalypse-Shema
Meaning	"Hear" or "Listen", in Hebrew (Deuteronomy 6:4)
Description	Shema is an AI companion that transforms biblical meditation from passive reading into an interactive and personalized dialogue. It guides the user from understanding to practical application ("Step of Faith") in their daily life, based on their current emotional and spiritual context.

3. How It Works (User Experience)
1.	Check-in & Contextualization:
o	Shema asks: "How are you feeling today?" or "What's on your mind right now?".
o	The user can also directly choose a biblical passage.
2.	Guided Dialogue with AI:
o	The AI analyzes the user's input and the biblical passage (chosen or suggested).
o	The conversation is structured in three phases:
o	Comprehension: Ex: "What do you think this passage tells us about God's character?"
o	Reflection: Ex: "How does this respond to the concern you shared earlier?"
o	Application: Ex: "What is one small, practical step you could take today to live this out?"
3.	"Step of Faith" Generation:
o	The AI synthesizes the conversation.
o	It proposes a unique, personalized action that the user can accept and schedule.
o	Example: "Today's Step of Faith: Send an encouraging message to Paul, specifically telling him you're praying for his family situation."
