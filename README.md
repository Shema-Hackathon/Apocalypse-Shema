# Apocalypse-Shema
We believe that Revelation, often seen as obscure and speculative, is above all a message of hope and victory.
With Apocalypse Shema, we want to transform this reading into a living experience: not just reading the Bible, but truly listening (Shema) to it in order to take concrete and transformative action in daily life.
